# Pacman Excercise: Animation Movement
## Description: 
Pacman Project
## Installation: 
To get started, I utilized VS to help create additional scripts. Then, apply this into the console to test the environment of the script. Through the pacman html file I called to two JSS scripts. 
## Usage: 
I can utilize these functions to create a game. Soon, we can apply trigger functions to help direct pacman to its destination. 
## Support: 
The are a couple resources that was used to help create this project. 
MDN: To help create a simulation - https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/play
Test Environment - Google Console, Microsoft Edge
Working on https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Games/Tutorials/2D_Breakout_game_pure_JavaScript/Collision_detection
## Roadmap: 
### Intial Phase: 
Here we created a frame. Pacman has movement in only one direction. 
### Second Phase: 
Directional movement by Pacman using arrow keys > Eats exploding paint balls by a click. 
### Final Phase: 
Items to create increased speed movement, increase size of Pacman to eat larger areas of the frame. Create more balls for each level with a set timer to increase difficulty level.
