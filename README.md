Roadmap: 
Intial Phase: Here we created a frame. Pacman has movement in only one direction. 
Second Phase: Directional movement by Pacman using arrow keys > Eats exploding paint balls by a click. 
Final Phase: Items to create increased speed movement, increase size of Pacman to eat larger areas of the frame. Create more balls for each level with a set timer to increase difficulty level.
